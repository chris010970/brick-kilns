# brick-kilns

Case study reviewing feasibility of training a U-Net based Convolutional Neural Network model to automatically identify and delineate brick kiln sites in Maxar Vivid RGB base map imagery captured over Pakistan. Source code developed for this study leverages functionality of the [unet-keras-collection](https://github.com/yingkaisha/keras-unet-collection) library.

Methodology and initial results are presented in a [Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/chris010970/brick-kilns/blob/main/notebooks/predict.ipynb).
